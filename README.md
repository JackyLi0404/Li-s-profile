# Some notes to JackyLi-s-profile

My pass Github account including all projects used school email to create which cannot use anymore.

Jacky Li's profile includes pass projects from 2018 to 2020 and some of them maybe lost.

The folder starts with "Pojrect" means it contains all files needed by the project, starts with "Program" means it only contains the codes, starts with "Report" means it only contains the reports and maybe along with presentation of the case study.
